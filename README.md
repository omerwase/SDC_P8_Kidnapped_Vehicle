# Kidnapped Vehicle Project


## Overview

This project implements markov localization using map landmarks and LIDAR sensor data. A kidnapped vehicle is simulated which must localize its position based on landmarks (map data) and LIDAR observations. This is achieved using a particle filter updated through Bayesian inference. The implementation can be found in [particle_filter.cpp](https://github.com/omerwase/SDC_P8_Kidnapped_Vehicle/blob/master/src/particle_filter.cpp). The program works in conjunction with [Udacity's Self Driving Car Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim).
